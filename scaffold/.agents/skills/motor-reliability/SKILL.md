description: Run authorized Motor reliability experiments for Coordinator failover, Decode engine-process restart, and Prefill NPU link-fault isolation/redundant recovery. Use for RAS, 高可用, 故障注入, 主备切换, 掉卡隔离, 进程重拉, or recovery validation. Read-only failure investigation belongs to motor-diagnosis.

# Motor reliability

Validate one explicitly selected recovery behavior against a live Motor
deployment. This Skill injects real faults only after a read-only plan and
explicit consent for the exact target. It does not deploy the service, edit its
config, or hide unsupported prerequisites.

Read `references/scenario-contracts.md` for the selected scenario only.

## Supported scenarios

| Scenario | Contract |
|---|---|
| Coordinator active/standby failover | `coordinator-failover` |
| Decode EngineServer process restart | `decode-engine-restart` |
| Prefill NPU parameter-plane link fault, isolation, and redundant recovery | `prefill-link-isolation` |

Online scaling, GPQA correctness, performance benchmarking, token-level replay,
and ScaleP2D are outside this Skill. Route explicit performance work to
`motor-benchmark`; do not treat a recovery experiment as performance evidence.

## Common workflow

1. Resolve the current endpoint, kube context, namespace, native config,
   topology, component Pods, Services, endpoints, node/card mapping, and
   software revisions. Use live state, not an earlier deployment record.
2. Read the selected scenario contract and run all of its read-only preflight.
   Require `motor-smoke` readiness and the smallest applicable
   `motor-functional` inference check to pass before injection.
3. Establish a baseline with timestamps: Pod UIDs/restarts, process IDs and
   command lines when applicable, Coordinator role/endpoints, P/D/E/U topology,
   and one controlled inference result.
4. Present a fault transaction containing:
   - exact endpoint, context, namespace, Pod/container, node, process, NPU, or
     link target;
   - injection command and blast radius;
   - expected intermediate and recovered states;
   - bounded observation deadline derived from live config or confirmed by the
     user;
   - exact cleanup/restoration plan and evidence directory;
   - low-impact continuous probe rate, request shape, and allowed error budget;
   - stop conditions.
5. Obtain explicit consent immediately before the mutation. Consent covers
   exactly one injection and the mandatory restoration stated in the same
   transaction. A retry or different target requires new consent.
6. Start the declared time-correlated request probe and state observation before
   injection, inject once, and poll states rather than sleeping a fixed
   duration. Preserve requests, events, and logs from before, during, and after
   the transition.
7. Run the scenario's recovery assertions. A final healthy snapshot alone does
   not pass; the required transition and replacement/re-election evidence must
   also exist.
8. Execute mandatory cleanup/restoration even when an assertion fails or the
   observation deadline expires. If restoration fails, stop other work,
   prominently report the unresolved target, and request operator intervention.
9. On FAIL, use `motor-diagnosis` before any restart, redeploy, config edit, or
   second injection. Use a specialized diagnosis Skill only when its entry
   markers match.

## Safety boundaries

- Never select a target using only `grep | head -1`, a partial name, a stale
  Pod IP, or a guessed device index. Refuse ambiguous targets.
- Before killing a process, record its PID, parent PID, full command line,
  container, Pod UID, and owning role. Recheck immediately before the signal;
  abort if PID identity changed.
- Before changing an NPU link, prove the target device/link belongs to the
  intended P instance and is not shared by unrelated workloads. Read the
  installed `hccn_tool` help and current link state. Do not assume command syntax
  or that `up` restores the original state.
- Do not inject into multiple components, processes, cards, or links in one
  experiment.
- Do not auto-repair with rollout restart, Pod deletion, deploy, scaling, or
  config mutation. Only the predeclared restoration intrinsic to the injected
  fault may run without a second approval.
- The continuous probe is reliability evidence, not a throughput benchmark.
  Keep it low-impact. Do not report uninterrupted availability unless it
  covered the transition and its allowed error budget was declared before
  injection.

## Evidence and result

Save raw evidence to a user-approved path or untracked
`.motor-workspace-local/reliability/<namespace>-<scenario>-<timestamp>/`. This
is an artifact directory, not a workflow gate. Include commands, UTC times,
resolved targets, redacted config facts, before/during/after snapshots,
requests, events, logs, cleanup results, and all assertion outcomes.

Report `PASS`, `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, or `RESTORATION FAILED`. Distinguish the
injected fault, observed transition, recovery, request failures/timeouts and
longest interruption, user-visible availability, and cleanup. Never convert
missing transition evidence into PASS.
