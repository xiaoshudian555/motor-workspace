# Remote-code-parity behavior reference

This file defines the durable behavior of `remote-code-parity`.

## Core contract

- Treat the local working tree as the source of truth.
- Use Git transport without requiring a real user commit.
- Keep sync container-only after machine attach.
- Keep all local parity state under `.motor-workspace-local/remote-code-parity/`.
- In session mode, derive the source worktree and target container from `.motor-workspace-local/sessions/<session-id>/session.json`.
- Fail closed when parity cannot be proven.
- Prove the final container-side commit ids instead of trusting command exit status alone.
- Stream phase progress on `stderr` as `__MWS_PARITY_PROGRESS__=<json>` and keep one final JSON payload on `stdout`.
- Keep runtime-install phases attributable instead of collapsing them into one opaque step: uninstall, `vllm`, `vllm-ascend` requirements, `vllm-ascend`, import verification, and marker write should each surface their own progress event.

## Apply-mode split

The remote toolbox exposes parity through three explicit modes:

- `source-only`: publish source snapshots to the container cache and upload a manifest; do not materialize runtime sources and do not install/rebuild.
- `materialize`: publish snapshots and update runtime sources; do not install/rebuild.
- `install`: full parity behavior, including first-install consent and reinstall triggers.

The `source-only` and `materialize` modes must not update runtime install state in a way that lets a later `install` run incorrectly skip first-install or rebuild gates.

## Sync mode gate

Before invoking parity for a container, the agent checks the persisted `sync_mode` in `install-consents.json`:

- `unset`: first use — agent must ask the user whether to sync local code (`local`) or use image-provided packages (`image`), then record via `install_consent.py set-sync-mode`.
- `local`: proceed with the full parity flow.
- `image`: `parity_sync.py` returns `status: skipped` immediately; the agent proceeds with remote execution using image-provided packages without syncing or installing.

If the user explicitly chooses local code and replacement of image packages, record both facts in one atomic write with `set-sync-mode --sync-mode local --allow-first-install --approved-by-user`. That prevents the later first-install consent write from clobbering sync-mode state and avoids a second prompt for the same logical container identity.

If `sync_mode` is still unset when `parity_sync.py` is invoked, the wrapper returns `status: blocked` before any remote mutation. `--force-reinstall` overrides `image` mode. The user can switch sync mode at any time.

## Scope and routing

`remote-code-parity` is an internal execution skill.

Intended route:

1. `machine-management` proves direct local -> container SSH and records the target in inventory.
2. `remote-code-parity` proves code and runtime package parity.
3. a higher-level serving / benchmark / smoke workflow executes the requested workload.

Normal agent-facing entrypoint: `parity_sync.py`.

Session-aware entrypoint:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/remote-code-parity/scripts/parity_sync.py --session-id <id>
```

Session mode sets `workspace_root` to the session worktree, `workspace_id` to the session id by default, and `container_identity` to `<session-container>@<runtime-root>`.

## Preconditions

Before this skill mutates anything remotely, confirm all of these:

- the target container already accepts direct local -> container key-based SSH
- the runtime root inside the container is known
- the workspace submodules required for execution are initialized and populated
- the selected machine record in inventory is the intended runtime target

## Source of truth and snapshot semantics

The snapshot source of truth is:

- tracked files
- staged files
- unstaged tracked changes
- untracked non-ignored files

The snapshot source of truth is **not**:

- ignored local caches
- `.motor-workspace-local/`
- temporary agent state
- other denylisted local-only files

Implementation rule:

- stage with `git add -A`
- then reset denylisted paths and child-submodule paths from the temporary index
- do **not** use `git add -A -f` for the main snapshot path

## Cache and transport model

The sync path does not rely on host storage.

Container-local cache root defaults to:

- `/root/.cache/mws/remote-code-parity`

Per-workspace layout:

```text
<cache-root>/
  workspaces/
    <workspace_id>/
      mirrors/
      locks/
      manifests/
```

Required behavior:

- create bare mirror repos inside the container cache root
- stream Git bundles directly from local -> container SSH, then fetch them into the container-local bare mirrors
- publish deterministic parentless tree snapshot commits so first use of an empty container mirror does not require shipping the full upstream history of large repos such as `vllm`
- avoid remote receive-pack negotiation for those parentless transport commits so the remote mirror does not need to fix up deltas against absent base history
- also publish an advertised branch ref inside each mirror so ordinary fetch paths can see the latest synthetic snapshot
- use a container-local lock while mutating cache or runtime state; locks carry owner metadata and stale lock directories are recovered after the bounded stale interval
- after failed or timed-out mirror hydration, best-effort terminate any matching legacy `git-receive-pack` process trees for that mirror and discard that repo's partial mirror before surfacing the failure
- do not create or reuse a shared flat host path such as `/home/mws`

## Runtime materialization model

Runtime root defaults to `/mnt/motor-workspace`.

Materialization requirements:

- initialize the root repo in place when `.git` is missing
- force the root repo and submodules to the synthetic snapshot commits
- rewrite submodule URLs to container-local mirror paths
- materialize child repos explicitly instead of relying on `git submodule update` to fetch synthetic child commits
- suppress transport-only child gitlink paths from parent `changed_paths` when a clean child repo only differs because it was represented by a parentless snapshot commit
- preserve runtime-private sibling paths such as `Mooncake` (image-provided runtime) and `.mws-runtime` (workspace-managed runtime artifacts, e.g. profiler dumps that downstream skills consume after parity refreshes)
- preserve `.remote-code-parity` so the container-side marker survives root cleanups
- do not delete the entire runtime root as part of normal sync

## First-time runtime replacement

The first sync against a fresh container has a special rule.

The container image may already include its own `vllm` / `vllm-ascend`. If the user wants remote execution to use the local workspace code, those image-provided packages must be replaced with editable installs from the synced source trees.

That step is mutating and potentially slow, so:

- require user consent once per logical container identity
- require `--approved-by-user` before writing consent state
- fail closed if the user declines or has not approved yet
- use a container-side marker under `/mnt/motor-workspace/.remote-code-parity/runtime-install.json` to detect whether first install already happened
- preserve existing per-container consent fields when writing first-install decisions or sync-mode decisions

First-install mutation boundary:

- uninstall image packages best-effort
- delete `/mnt/motor-workspace/vllm`
- delete `/mnt/motor-workspace/vllm-ascend`
- keep the rest of `/mnt/motor-workspace`, including `Mooncake` and `.mws-runtime`

## Reinstall trigger matrix

Reinstall fires when **any** of these conditions is true:

### Trigger 1 — changed-path pattern match

#### `vllm`

Trigger reinstall on changes matching:

- `requirements*`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `setup.py`
- `setup.cfg`
- `CMakeLists.txt`
- `cmake/**`
- `csrc/**`
- common native-source suffixes such as `*.cu`, `*.cuh`, `*.cpp`, `*.cc`, `*.h`, `*.hpp`

#### `vllm-ascend`

Trigger reinstall on the same set as `vllm`, plus:

- `vllm_ascend/_cann_ops_custom/**`

Everything else defaults to parity-only, no reinstall.

### Trigger 2 — commit drift from last sync

Compare each repo's real `source_head` commit with `last_head_commits` in `runtime-state.json`. Synthetic snapshot commits are parentless transport commits, so drift detection must use the underlying HEAD to avoid false positives from dirty pure-Python edits while still detecting submodule version switches. If the HEAD differs (e.g. submodule version switch via `git checkout`), trigger reinstall for that repo even when `changed_paths` is empty because the tree matches the new HEAD.

### Trigger 3 — dependency cascade

When `vllm` triggers reinstall (by either trigger above), `vllm-ascend` is also reinstalled because it depends on `vllm` internals.

### Uninstall scope

Only uninstall the packages that will actually be reinstalled:

- `reinstall_vllm` only → uninstall `vllm`
- `reinstall_vllm_ascend` only → uninstall `vllm-ascend` / `vllm_ascend`
- both → uninstall all three

On first install the reinstall-branch uninstall step is skipped because `first_install_prepare_script` already removed image-provided packages.

### Force reinstall

`--force-reinstall` unconditionally sets `reinstall_vllm` and `reinstall_vllm_ascend` to true, overriding all trigger logic. The full sync flow still runs (snapshot, mirror hydration, materialize, install, verify). Useful for recovering from a broken editable install or validating the install pipeline without touching source files.

### No-change fast path

When all snapshot commits match `last_snapshot_commits` and no reinstall trigger fires (and `--force-reinstall` is not set), the sync verifies the container-side commits with a single SSH call and returns `status == ready` immediately, skipping mirror hydration, materialize, and manifest upload.

## Exact proof to collect

A trustworthy parity result records:

- container cache root actually used
- published synthetic commit ids
- checked-out commit ids in the container
- whether `vllm` and `vllm-ascend` were reinstalled
- whether first-time consent was consulted or blocked
- any mismatch between the manifest and runtime state

## Runtime install compatibility

- discover the runtime Python dynamically from `/usr/local/python*/bin/python3`, then fall back to `python3` or `python`
- unify that interpreter across `python`, `python3`, `HI_PYTHON`, `Python_EXECUTABLE`, `Python3_EXECUTABLE`, and CMake-driven helper processes before editable install
- preseed the runtime `PATH` and the Ascend driver `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` prefix, then source optional env scripts under a `set +u` / `set -u` guard so shell-specific variables are not required
- source `/etc/profile.d/mws-ascend-env.sh`, versioned CANN roots such as `/usr/local/Ascend/cann-9.0.0/set_env.sh`, ascend-toolkit roots, ATB, and the runtime-root-relative custom op `set_env.bash` when present
- keep the fast path on `pip install --no-deps -e . --no-build-isolation`; editable installs must not run dependency resolution
- set `TORCH_DEVICE_BACKEND_AUTOLOAD=0` for the `vllm` editable install because `VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE=empty` does not need `torch_npu` during metadata generation
- compute `MWS_BUILD_JOBS=min(available CPUs, 128)` and export it through both `MAX_JOBS` and `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` so `vllm-ascend` top-level and nested CMake builds get bounded parallelism
- keep dependency ownership in `pip install -r vllm-ascend/requirements.txt`, which pins the CANN-compatible `numpy` / `triton-ascend` stack
- route pip installs through the single A3-tested HuaweiCloud index (`https://repo.huaweicloud.com/repository/pypi/simple`)
- do not bootstrap, install, or invoke `uv` as part of parity
- do not retry across mirror candidates or retry editable installs by dropping `--no-build-isolation`
- if editable install fails, report the captured install log and fail closed instead of changing package sources, refreshing the packaging stack, or changing install flags
- finish runtime verification with real imports, not `find_spec()` alone, and keep the generated heredoc smoke snippet valid Python after shell quoting
- after import smoke test, verify all `vllm-ascend` declared dependencies are version-satisfied (`verify-deps`); if a mismatch is detected (e.g. `numpy<2.0.0` but `numpy 2.x` installed), report `failed` instead of running a repair install
- surface a progress transition before each long runtime-install package step so an agent can tell whether the wait is in uninstall, requirements, editable install, or verification
- keep consent and runtime-state writes atomic so parallel wrapper calls do not clobber local state
