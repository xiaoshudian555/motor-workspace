# Repo-init acceptance criteria

## Trigger examples

These should trigger `repo-init`:

- “Initialize this workspace.”
- “Set up GitHub CLI and sign me in.”
- “Initialize submodules and point `vllm-ascend` to my fork.”
- “Configure my remotes for PR work.”
- “初始化这个仓库，顺便把后面远端机器要用的用户名也配好。”

## Non-trigger examples

These should not trigger `repo-init` unless setup is the obvious blocker:

- “Fix this failing test.”
- “Explain how scheduling works.”
- “Run the benchmark suite.”
- “Update README wording.”
- “帮我配置一台远端 NPU 机器。”

## Success criteria

A successful run should satisfy all applicable items below.

### Universal

- probes first before mutating
- asks before each mutation category
- allows partial completion
- never writes personal remotes, secrets, or machine profile state into tracked files
- preserves extra remotes

### Decision checkpoint

- for broad init, the skill stops after the first probe summary and asks for:
  - machine username choice if the profile is missing
  - repo topology choice
  - submodule-init choice
  - vllm version alignment choice (when the probe shows submodules are uninitialized)
- the machine-username branch uses exactly three options:
  - `git-username`
  - `random`
  - `custom`
- the skill does not silently assume a generated username for broad init
- the skill does not silently apply the recommended topology when the user only asked for generic init
- if the user picks `custom`, the skill asks one follow-up text question for the literal username before mutating
- the skill does not silently replace `custom` with the detected Git username

### Local machine profile

- broad workspace init reuses or creates `.motor-workspace-local/machine-profile.json`
- machine usernames accept English letters and digits only
- profile creation normalizes usernames to lowercase
- random/default creation uses the `agent#####` format
- `repo_init_profile.py plan` returns the fixed-choice question when the profile is missing
- `repo_init_profile.py apply --choice custom` without `--custom-username` returns `needs_input`
- narrow Git-only tasks do not force profile creation

### Tooling and auth

- chooses the correct platform install path for `gh`
- offers a no-admin fallback when needed
- verifies GitHub auth after login
- asks before generating or uploading SSH keys

### Submodules and topology

- initializes submodules recursively when the user approved it
- resolves CI-pinned vLLM alignment with `resolve_vllm_ci_pin.py`, preferring `.github/vllm-main-verified.commit` over older workflow/docs fallbacks
- completes submodule init before configuring submodule remotes
- `repo_topology.py configure --repo <submodule>` errors out when the submodule is not initialized (git root mismatch)
- preserves nonstandard remotes
- keeps tracked files on community URLs
- uses quiet remote comparison instead of broad prune-heavy fetches
- moves local branches only with approval when worktrees are clean enough
