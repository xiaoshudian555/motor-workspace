# Repo-init behavior reference

This file defines the durable behavior of `repo-init`.

## Core contract

- Probe first.
- Ask before each mutation category.
- Preserve user choices and extra remotes.
- Keep user-specific topology and machine profile state local, not tracked.
- Prefer helper scripts to raw shell.
- Prefer quiet single-branch comparisons over broad ref pruning.

## Local-state contract

Repo-local runtime state lives under `.motor-workspace-local/`.

Relevant files:

- `.motor-workspace-local/machine-profile.json`
- `.motor-workspace-local/machine-inventory.json`

Rules:

- keep the directory untracked
- create the machine profile during broad workspace init, not for every narrow Git-only task
- machine usernames must be letters and digits only
- normalize machine usernames to lowercase
- the random/default format is `agent#####`
- do not rewrite an existing machine profile unless the user explicitly asked for that change
- during broad init, prefer `repo_init_profile.py` over calling `workspace_profile.py ensure` directly

## Stage model

### Stage 0: applicability

Use `repo-init` only for workspace setup, GitHub auth / CLI setup, recursive submodules, fork / remote topology, and the local machine profile during broad init.

### Stage 1: read-only probe

Use `repo_init_probe.py` to collect:

- platform and package-manager availability
- `gh` install state
- GitHub auth state and login
- local workspace machine profile state
- submodule status
- repo remote topology for `workspace`, `vllm`, and `vllm-ascend`
- whether matching personal forks appear to exist

### Stage 2: mandatory decision checkpoint

Before mutating a broad init or any topology-changing task, stop once and ask a grouped question.

That question must cover:

- machine username choice when the profile is missing
- repo topology mode: keep current, recommended fork mode, or community-only
- whether to initialize submodules now
- vllm submodule version alignment (CI-pinned / upstream main / keep current) — always include this when the probe shows submodules are uninitialized, because all questions are asked in one batch and you cannot wait for the submodule-init answer first; ignore the answer if the user later declines submodule init

For the machine username branch, use the fixed three-option model from `repo_init_profile.py plan`:

- `git-username`
- `random`
- `custom`

Rules:

- do not silently generate a username when the user only asked for generic init
- do not silently rewire remotes when the user only asked for generic init
- do not treat `custom` as permission to reuse the detected Git username
- if the user selects `custom`, stop again and ask for the literal username before any mutation

### Stage 3: ensure local machine profile when relevant

During broad workspace init:

- inspect the profile first with `repo_init_profile.py plan`
- if missing and the user chose `git-username`, call `repo_init_profile.py apply --choice git-username`
- if missing and the user explicitly accepted the default/random option, call `repo_init_profile.py apply --choice random`
- if missing and the user chose `custom`, first ask for the literal username, then call `repo_init_profile.py apply --choice custom --custom-username ...`
- do not change an existing profile unless the user explicitly asked to change it

For narrow Git-only tasks, skip this stage.

### Stage 4: ensure tooling and auth

- Prefer official install paths when privilege exists.
- Use the bundled fallback installers when privilege does not exist.
- Verify auth with `gh auth status` and `gh api user --jq .login`.
- Prefer SSH for Git operations when feasible.

### Stage 5: submodules

Always use recursive sync + init for this repo.

When the user chose CI-pinned vLLM alignment, resolve the tested vLLM ref with
`resolve_vllm_ci_pin.py` after `vllm-ascend/` is populated. The resolver
prefers `.github/vllm-main-verified.commit`, which is the current upstream
source of truth, and falls back to older workflow/docs sources for older
checkouts. Report the resolver source in the summary so later remote install
or parity work can tell which pairing was deployed.

### Stage 6: topology

Use `repo_topology.py configure` for remote mutations.

**Prerequisite**: Stage 5 (submodule init) must be complete before configuring submodule remotes. `repo_topology.py` will refuse to operate on a path whose git root resolves to a different directory (e.g. an uninitialized submodule falling through to the parent workspace).

Rules:

- do not delete nonstandard remotes
- add `upstream` only when it helps the chosen workflow
- `vllm` user fork is optional
- `vllm-ascend` user fork is recommended but not mandatory
- if the user chose "keep current", do not rewrite remotes just because the recommended topology differs
- configure workspace remotes first, then submodule remotes (after submodule init)

### Stage 7: main-branch comparison and tracking

Use `repo_topology.py compare-main` for branch-head comparison.

Use `repo_topology.py ensure-main` for local `main` tracking.

Rules:

- do not use `git fetch --prune` only to inspect divergence
- fetch only the branch that matters
- if the worktree is dirty, ask before switching branches or pulling
- do not hard reset without explicit approval

### Stage 8: optional fork sync

Only sync a user fork when the user explicitly approves it.

Preferred command:

```bash
gh repo sync USER/REPO --source OWNER/REPO
```

## Quiet-output rules

- `git fetch --prune` is too noisy for inspection because deleted fork refs can flood the transcript.
- Prefer `git ls-remote --heads <remote> main` or the helper script.
- When a command is noisy, capture it to a log and show a concise summary or short tail.

## Canonical success shape

A successful run usually ends with:

- the local machine profile present when broad init asked for it
- the machine-profile branch used one of the fixed choices: `git-username`, `random`, or `custom`
- `gh` installed or a fallback provided
- GitHub auth valid
- recursive submodules initialized when the user approved it
- remotes matching the user's selected topology
- local `main` tracking the selected working remote where the user approved branch movement
